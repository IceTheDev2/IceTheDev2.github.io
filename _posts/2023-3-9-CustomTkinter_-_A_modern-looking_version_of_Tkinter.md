title: CustomTkinter - A modern-looking version of Tkinter
---

## Intro
Tkinter is a vast and easy-to-use library for Python GUI (Graphical User Interfaces). But, it can often look clunky and outdated...

(Thanks, ChatGPT!)

In my case, I had an awkward slider, for which I was looking for a quick and easy solution to customise.

As I was skimming over the Google search results, I stumbled upon a video I ignored at first; I thought it wouldn't address the issue I was facing.

Despite my restraints, I clicked on it.

John Elder from codemy.com went on to present a recently-released library similar to Tkinter, but with modern looking GUI. When I saw how pleasant the widgets looked and after I checked out the [Wiki of the project's repository](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/wiki/CTkSlider), and discovered how easy it was to customise, I was thrilled. I could finally make my app look charming.

## Passwordsy's transition from Tkinter to CustomTkinter
I immediately started to take every type of widget in my Tkinter program and transition it to CustomTkinter. Although it's still work in progress, Passwordsy is already looking much more appealing.

Now, a sneak peek for my blog readers...

(This is a version in development. The final release is likely to differ significantly.)


## Conclusion
Thank you to codemy.com for making [that video](tps://youtu.be/JDU-ycsxvqM) and to [Tom Schimansky](https://github.com/TomSchimansky) for creating [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/) in the first place.

Although Tkinter is a great library and it's easy to use in terms of creating usable GUI, it's often not easy to customise that GUI. CustomTkinter gets rid of that problem and provides an easy-to-use solution to create pretty user interfaces.

Also, today is the 1 month anniversary of this blog.
