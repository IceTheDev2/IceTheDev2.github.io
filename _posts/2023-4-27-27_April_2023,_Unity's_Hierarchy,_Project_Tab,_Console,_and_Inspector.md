title: 27 April 2023, Unity's Hierarchy, Project Tab, Console, and Inspector
---

## üîçIntroduction
Welcome to part 3 of IceTheDev2's beginner's guide to Unity.

In the [last post](https://icethedev2.github.io/(20_April_2023)_How_to_Update_Unity,_Unity's_menu_bar/), we discussed how to update Unity and its menu bar.

In this post, we will discuss the remaining user interface elements.

## The Hierarchy
The Hierarchy allows you to organize and manage your game's objects, which are the building blocks of your game. You can create, modify, and organize game objects to define the gameplay mechanics, visuals, and interactions of your game.

The Hierarchy is located on the left side of the screen in the Default layout......

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836815748/in/dateposted-public/" title="75"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836815748_1e04e5fe56_o.png" alt="75"/>

It contains the current open scene (a scene is equivalent to a level), which by default is the SampleScene and its objects (by default the Main Camera - the camera through which the player would see the game - and the Directional Light - a virtual light that mimics the effect of sunlight or moonlight).

To add a new object, right-click within the Hierarchy panel...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836558154/in/dateposted-public/" title="76"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836558154_1726674acc_o.png" alt="76"/></a>

...and a contextual menu containing many selections of objects will pop up. We will discuss how to use these options later.
 
## üìÅThe Project Tab
The Project Tab provides an overview of your project's assets and resources. Assets can include anything from images, sounds, and models to scripts and prefabs (a template for an object).

At the bottom of the window, the project tab can be found...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836779980/in/dateposted-public/" title="77"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836779980_281e140216_o.png" alt="77"/></a>

It contains the assets (files) in your project. To open a certain folder in File Explorer or your software's equivalent, right-click on the folder in Unity (in the left-side of the project tab or in the right-side)...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52835801892/in/dateposted-public/" title="78"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52835801892_6ca4f8e0ee_o.png" alt="78"/></a>

...and click 'Show in Explorer'.

## üìúThe Console
The Console is a powerful tool for debugging and testing your game. It allows you to see error, warnings, and messages generated by Unity or your scripts, helping you identify and fix issues in your code.

To switch to the Console, click on the Console tab at the bottom of the screen...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836380771/in/dateposted-public/" title="79"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836380771_6f27d233e4_o.png" width="1953" height="478" alt="79"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Console panel is most commonly used for testing and debugging (finding and removing bugs) in code. We will use it frequently when writing scripts.

For now, I'll explain some of the Console panel's buttons and icons:
- Clear: Clears the console of any errors, warnings, or messages. By default the console is cleared on Play, on Build, and on Recompile, but you can change this within the little arrow, next to the 'Clear' button...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836787310/in/dateposted-public/" title="80"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836787310_0a68a40878_o.png" alt="80"/></a>

- Collapse: It groups messages/warnings/errors of the same nature into one space, showing only the latest rather than each one on a separate space by default.

- Error Pause: Prevents errors from appearing in the Console panel.

- <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52835813167/in/dateposted-public/" title="82"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52835813167_631055818d_o.png" alt="82"/></a> Warnings: represents the number of warnings

- <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836838673/in/dateposted-public/" title="83"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836838673_d6f3c89d15_o.png" alt="83"/></a> Errors: represents the number of errors

## üëÅÔ∏èThe Inspector
If no object is selected the inspector is empty...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836840333/in/dateposted-public/" title="84"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836840333_48e5a59b1e_o.png" alt="84"/></a>

Select an object, the Cube (which we created in a [previous post](https://icethedev2.github.io/(13_April_2023)_How_to_Get_Started_with_the_Unity_Game_Engine-_Scene_and_Game_View/#:~:text=To%20create%20an%20cube%2C%20for%20example%2C%20right%2Dclick%20in%20the%20Hierarchy%20(by%20default%20on%20the%20left%20side)%2C%20select%20%E2%80%983D%20Object%E2%80%99%20%2D%3E%20%E2%80%98Cube%E2%80%99%E2%80%A6)), for example...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836799870/in/dateposted-public/" title="85"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836799870_0aa8fc0ac9_o.png" alt="85"/></a>

...and you'll see it turned blue in the hierarchy. If you look to the rightüëÄ...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836583719/in/dateposted-public/" title="86"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836583719_7b7382178b_o.png" alt="86"/></a>

...you'll see a bunch of stuff just appeared in the inspector!

If you select each one of the other objects (the Main Camera and the Directional Light), you'll see each has a Transform component, which is pretty self-explanatory if you look at its values: position, rotation, and scale.

There are many components in Unity which we'll discuss at a later time.

You'll also notice each object has an 'Untagged' tag and is on the 'Default' layer...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52836403691/in/dateposted-public/" title="87"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52836403691_9609c2a572_o.png" alt="87"/></a>

...The tag is used to group similar object together. An example use is detecting collision based on a group instead of each object's name.

The layer is commonly used in 2D games to determine which objects show on top if they overlap.

We will discuss these two in a later post.

## Conclusion
Overall, these UI (user interface) elements are integral components of the Unity development workflow. Understanding how to use them effectively is essential for creating high-quality games that are stable, organized, and free of bugs.

Unity is a brilliant way to get into game development. The best way to learn any programming language or game engine is to build something you are truly passionate about with great consistency.
