title: 11 May 2023, Planning, Game Engine | How to Make a Video Game Part 1
---

So, you want to make a video game.

You might have a unique idea or you're just interested in the concept of game development.

The first thing you need to do is have a comprehensive idea of your game. 

## Planning the Game
Spend some time thinking about what you want in a game. Ideally, you'd have a one-page document, detailing the concepts of that game: from the game's vision, mechanics, and objectives to what types of power-ups there will, how you will monetise it, and what game modes there will be. 

Just authentically write what your ideas are - they might be bad, it does not matter. Just get them written down - you can sort them out if they're bad, and if they're not, you got yourself a good idea.

Once you have a clear understanding of your game, you can move onto the next step.

For this tutorial series, we will build a Maze Runner.

## Choosing a Game Engine
A game engine is a program - a tool - you will use to build a video game, similar to a video or photo editor. There are several out there, each with they're pros and cons. Here are some popular game engines that you can consider:
- Unreal Engine: Unreal Engine is a popular game engine that offers stunning visuals and excellent performance. It supports advanced features such as dynamic lighting and particle effects. 
- Unity: Unity is [the most commonly-used game engine](https://itch.io/game-development/engines/most-projects) with a large community and a vast array of features. It supports most platforms and offers great 3D graphics and physics simulation.
- Godot Engine: Godot Engine is a lightweight game engine that offers a simple and intuitive interface. It is easy to learn and offers great 2D and 3D support.

I ordered those based on their advance-ness. Unreal Engine offers a lot of features, many too complicated for beginners. Godot is lightweight, so it might lack in some features. That's why I recommend Unity (as it's not too difficult, but also has a lot of features; we will use it in these tutorials), but don't be afraid to try out any of them.

## Conclusion
Developing a video game requires a lot of effort and dedication, but with the right tools, guidance, and motivation to be consistent (consistency is the most important thing in learning any skill) it's an achievable goal. In the future articles, I'll walk you through the entire process, from creating the game world to programming the player movement, adding enemies and obstacles, and implementing game logic.

Unity is a brilliant way to get into game development. The best way to learn any programming language or game engine is to build something you are truly passionate about with great consistency.
