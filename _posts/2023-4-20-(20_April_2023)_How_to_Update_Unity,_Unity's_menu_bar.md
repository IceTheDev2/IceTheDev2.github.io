title: (20 April 2023) How to Update Unity, Unity's menu bar
---

## Introduction
Welcome to part 2 of IceTheDev2's Unity beginner's guide.

In the [last post](https://icethedev2.github.io/(13_April_2023)_How_to_Get_Started_with_the_Unity_Game_Engine-_Scene_and_Game_View/), we discussed how to install Unity, the Scene, and Game view.

In this post, we will discuss updating Unity, loading projects in newer version, and Unity's menu bar.

## Opening your project
Start by opening up Unity Hub...

...and click on your project (in this case 'blog-tutorial').

## Installing a new version
Head to the 'Installs' tab on the left side of Unity Hub...

...Click on the blue 'Install Editor' button...

...and click the blue 'Install' button next to the version you want to install. In this case, I have already installed the latest version of Unity (as of 17 April 2023 it is 2021.3.23f1).

## Changing the version of an existing project
Head to the 'Projects' tab of Unity Hub (the one that's open by default when you start up the app) and hover over the 'Editor Version' option of the project you want to change the version of...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52823573567/in/dateposted-public/" title="72"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52823573567_968c8cd9ab_o.png" alt="72"/></a>

...Click on that option...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52824327009/in/dateposted-public/" title="73"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52824327009_d581808dbe_o.png" alt="73"/></a>

...Select the version you want to change the project to and click 'Open with **version**', in this case 'Open with 2021.3.23f1'. Clicking the 'Open' button will automatically open the project in that version, not only change its version.

Also, make sure to click any 'Continue' or 'OK' buttons that you encounter as the project changes its version.

## Unity's menu bar
By 'menu bar' I'm refering to these...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197764307@N08/52824598033/in/dateposted-public/" title="74"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52824598033_cc00896baf_o.png" alt="74"/></a>

...I will provide you with a list of useful functions and where they are within these buttons if you want to come back to this post.

### File
- New Scene (creates a new scene; a scene in Unity is roughly equivalent to a level); Shortcut: CTRL + N
- Open Scene (opens an open dialog box so you can select a scene - a .unity file - to open in unity); Shortcut: CTRL + O
- Save (saves the current scene's changes); Shortcut: CTRL + S
- Build Settings (opens a box that lets you change some properties when exporting your game); Shorcut: CTRL + Shift + B

### Edit
- Project Settings (opens a box containing many settings for your project)
- Preferences (opens a box that lets you change stuff like the default code editor to open scripts in)

### Assets
- Show in Explorer (opens the project in the File Explorer or your OS's equivalent)

### Window
- Layouts (lets you select a layout from a list of preset layouts, among which is the default layout)
- Animation (lets you open the 'Animation' window, whose shortcut is CTRL + 6)

## Conclusion
