**2 March 2023, work in progress update**


Great progress has been made on Passwordsy in the past month.

I have to say that this is my most profound stint with programming, I had quite few in the past, especially with Unity, but none of them have brought me so far as to passionately work on a project for months.
Thank you to everyone who reads and to everyone who helped me in any way, by giving me ideas or by just checking my projects out. I would not have been here without you <3
