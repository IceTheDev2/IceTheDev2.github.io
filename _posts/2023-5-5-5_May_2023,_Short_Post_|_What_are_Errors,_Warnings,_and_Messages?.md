title: 5 May 2023, Short Post | What are Errors, Warnings, and Messages?
---

Consider this part 5 of IceTheDev2's Unity beginner guide.

## Errors
Errors are grave problems in the code or project that prevent the game from being run at all. 

Examples of errors include syntax errors (such as forgetting a semi-colon), missing files, and unresolved references.

## Warnings
Warnings are problems within the code or project, but not as severe as errors. Although they do not prevent the game from being run, they must be addressed immediately to prevent errors. 

Examples of warnings include unused variables, deprecated functions, and missing components.

## Messages
Messages are purely informational and cannot lead to errors. Therefore, they do not prevent the code from being run, though attention should still be paid to them as they can carry useful information about the state of the game.

Examples of messages include information about loading assets, initializing objects, and printing debug information.

## Conclusion
Errors are problems in the game that prevent it from being run. Warnings are less severe (they don't prevent the game from being run), but should still be addressed. Messages do not indicate a problem within the project, but instead they indicate important information.

Unity is a brilliant way to get into game development. The best way to learn any programming language or game engine is to build something you are truly passionate about with great consistency.
