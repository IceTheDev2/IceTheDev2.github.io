I am a 14-year-old passionate about coding and I will document my journey on this blog!
I am currently working on [light-game](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/light-game), a game with a unique mechanic of a light that follows your cursor and gets bigger and more intense the faster you move in Unity and C#, and [Passwordsy](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/[Passwordsy](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/light-game)), a password generator and a password strength checker, in Python and Tkinter.
